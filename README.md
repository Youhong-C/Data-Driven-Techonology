# Data-Driven-Techonology
The Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) technique is demonstrated through an illustrative application involving a simple four-dimensional system. The system's dynamic matrix 𝐴 is reconstructed using the DMD method. The time-domain simulation results are compared with those derived from the original 𝐴 matrix, as well as the conventional DMD and exact DMD methods.
